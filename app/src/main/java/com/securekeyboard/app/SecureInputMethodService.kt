/**
 * SecureInputMethodService
 *
 * Privacy guarantees this class is designed to uphold:
 *
 * 1. NOTHING TYPED IS EVER STORED. Key presses are sent straight to the
 *    focused text field via InputConnection.commitText() and are never
 *    written to a variable, file, database, or log that outlives the
 *    single key press. There is no history buffer, no "recent words"
 *    file, no analytics call, anywhere in this class.
 *
 * 2. NO NETWORK ACCESS IS POSSIBLE. This entire app declares no
 *    android.permission.INTERNET in the manifest, so even if this code
 *    were modified to try to send data somewhere, the Android sandbox
 *    would block the socket at the OS level.
 *
 * 3. SCREENSHOTS OF THE KEYBOARD ARE BLOCKED where the platform allows
 *    it, via WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SECURE on this input
 *    window. See onCreateInputView().
 *
 * Limitations to be upfront about (see README):
 * - FLAG_SECURE blocks Android's built-in screenshot/screen-recording
 *   APIs. It cannot stop someone physically photographing the screen
 *   with another camera, and it cannot override a rooted device with
 *   modified system software.
 * - The app you're typing INTO (e.g. a chat app) still receives the
 *   text you type, exactly as it would with any keyboard - that's
 *   how typing works. This keyboard only guarantees that this app,
 *   specifically, does not add any collection, storage, or
 *   transmission of what you type.
 *
 * FIXED IN THIS VERSION: key row height used to be a hardcoded raw pixel
 * value (130px), which is NOT device-independent - the same number
 * produced a huge key on an old low-density screen and a tiny sliver on
 * a modern high-density screen. It's now computed in dp (see dpToPx)
 * from a user-adjustable preference (Settings > keyboard height), so it
 * looks consistent across devices and the user - not a one-time
 * hardcoded guess - controls how tall the keys are.
 *
 * WORD SUGGESTIONS - how this fits the privacy guarantees above:
 * A suggestion strip was added above the key rows, backed by two fixed,
 * read-only, bundled-in-the-APK data files derived from a public Arabic
 * news corpus: a word-frequency list for prefix completion (see
 * WordDictionary.kt) and a word-pair list for NEXT-word prediction - the
 * instant a word is finished, likely following words are offered before
 * anything of the next word is typed (see NextWordDictionary.kt). On top
 * of that, THIS APP'S OWN sensitive fields (and any other app's field
 * marked the same way) get a stricter guarantee than the rest of the
 * device - see the split below.
 *
 * ⚠️ IMPORTANT UPDATE - guarantee #1 above is now SCOPED, not global:
 *
 * - IN A FIELD MARKED SENSITIVE (password type, or
 *   TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS - this includes this app's own
 *   EncryptActivity message/key fields, see activity_encrypt.xml):
 *   guarantee #1 still holds EXACTLY as before. No suggestions are
 *   shown, nothing typed there is added to any dictionary, and the only
 *   state kept is the transient [currentWord] buffer, cleared
 *   immediately on space/enter/field-switch/keyboard-hide.
 *
 * - IN ANY OTHER FIELD (i.e. normal typing in any other app, since this
 *   is installable as the device's system keyboard): completed words
 *   (on space/enter/tapped suggestion) are now saved to a small
 *   per-device, per-word frequency file (see LearnedDictionary.kt) so
 *   suggestions improve based on the user's own vocabulary over time.
 *   This is real, new, on-device storage of individual words typed
 *   outside this app's own sensitive screens - read LearnedDictionary.kt's
 *   class doc for the full, honest scope of what that does and does not
 *   mean (never transmitted anywhere - still no INTERNET permission
 *   anywhere in the app; never full messages, only individual words with
 *   a typed-count; excluded from Android backups like the rest of this
 *   app's data; user-clearable anytime from Settings).
 *
 * FIXED IN THIS VERSION - suggestion bar layout jump: the suggestion
 * strip used to be View.GONE when there was nothing to suggest, which
 * removes it from the layout entirely and makes every row of keys below
 * it jump up/down as the user types (bar appears/disappears). It now
 * uses View.INVISIBLE instead, which keeps its height permanently
 * reserved in the layout - the keys never move, whether or not
 * suggestions are currently showing.
 *
 * ADDED IN THIS VERSION - two long-press behaviors, neither of which
 * changes any key's position in its row:
 * 1. Hamza popup on ا: long-pressing ا (and dragging, like a normal
 *    Android popup key) picks between ا / أ / إ / آ - the hamza forms
 *    that were missing before. See [LETTER_VARIANTS], [showVariantPopup].
 * 2. Tatweel (kashida, "ـ") hold-to-extend: holding down any other
 *    letter key (instead of a quick tap) repeatedly inserts the ـ
 *    elongation character instead of repeating the letter, so the user
 *    can stretch a word for emphasis/calligraphic effect. A quick tap
 *    still always just types the letter as before.
 *
 * FIXED IN THIS VERSION - the current word used to be "forgotten" the
 * moment backspace crossed back over a space into an already-finished
 * word (or the moment the user tapped the cursor into the middle of one):
 * [currentWord] was only ever built forward, one appended letter at a
 * time, so anything that put the cursor somewhere it hadn't typed
 * through left the buffer empty and suggestions stuck off until a brand
 * new word was started. [currentWord] is now re-derived from the actual
 * field content around the cursor - see [resyncCurrentWordFromField] -
 * both after backspace and on every cursor move ([onUpdateSelection]),
 * so going back into a word (by backspacing OR by tapping) restores it
 * in full instead of starting over.
 *
 * ADDED IN THIS VERSION - saved phrases: finishing a line with إدخال
 * (Enter) now also learns that whole line as a phrase (see
 * [PhraseDictionary]), gated by the exact same suggestionsEnabled check
 * as everything else here. This is a bigger privacy trade-off than
 * single-word learning - PhraseDictionary.kt's class doc spells out
 * exactly what that does and doesn't mean, and it's wipeable separately
 * from the learned-words list in Settings.
 *
 * FIXED IN THIS VERSION - dark mode never visibly applied: this view is
 * only ever built once per keyboard session, so its colors (from
 * res/values/colors.xml or res/values-night/colors.xml) were resolved
 * once and never re-resolved when the system's dark/light mode changed
 * afterwards. See [appliedNightMode], [onConfigurationChanged], and the
 * extra check added to onStartInputView - the view now rebuilds itself
 * whenever the applied night mode differs from what's currently applied.
 *
 * FIXED IN THIS VERSION (deeper bug behind the above) - the keyboard
 * didn't actually turn black when "الوضع الليلي" was chosen INSIDE the
 * app's own theme settings, only when the PHONE's system dark mode was
 * also on: this Service (unlike the AppCompatActivity screens) never
 * consulted AppCompatDelegate's forced night mode at all, only the raw
 * system Configuration. Every color/drawable this keyboard draws now
 * goes through ThemeUtil, which resolves everything against
 * Prefs.isDarkMode() directly (see ThemeUtil.themedContext()) - the
 * app's own toggle is the one actual source of truth everywhere now, not
 * the phone's separate system setting. The night palette itself
 * (res/values-night/colors.xml) was also given more contrast between the
 * keyboard surface, key faces, and borders - same shapes/corners/
 * elevation as before, just clearer separation between them instead of
 * reading as a flat, slightly-hazy dark gray.
